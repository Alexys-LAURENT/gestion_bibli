Potem stworzył ryby, te były jednak głupie i leniwe. Wziął więc dusze kilku delfinów, które przynajmniej nauczyły się mówić, zmieszał je z gliną, ugniótł w dłoniach, aż zmieniły kształt i stały się ludźmi. Ludzie byli mądrzy, ale nie byli w stanie pływać cały dzień, Imo wykopał więc więcej gliny, ugniótł ją, a potem wypalił w ognisku swego rybackiego obozowiska. W ten sposób powstał ląd.",

They're mopping when I come out the dorm, all three of them sulky and hating everything, the time of day, the place they're at here, the people they got to work around. When they hate like this, better if they don't see me. I creep along me wall quiet as dust in my canvas shoes, but they got special sensitive equipment detects my fear and they all look up, all three at once, eyes glittering out of the black faces like the hard glitter of radio tubes out of the back of an old radio. 'Here's the Chief. The soo-pah Chief, fellas. Ol' Chief Broom. Here you go, Chief Broom....' Stick a mop in my hand and motion to the spot they aim for me to clean today, and I go. One swats the backs of my legs with a broom handle to hurry me past. Haw, you look at 'im shag it? Big enough to eat apples off my head an' he mine me like a baby.",
